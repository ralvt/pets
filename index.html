        <h2>How to Adopt?</h2>
        <p>When you go looking for a pet, keep one thing in mind; adoption is the most feasible, cost effective, and
            needed type of pet.

        </p>

        <div class="indent">
            <p>Getting a good pet involves a bit of <span class="term">research</span>. You will need to know the
                type of pets available in your locations as well
                as the time of day it is best to find the right pet. Some pets will only be available during
                certain <span class="term">seasons</span> of the year, while
                others will be around all year long.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a good idea to record the location, day and time of any adopted animals. This information will be
                useful in recalling age and the event of adoption for future celebrations.
